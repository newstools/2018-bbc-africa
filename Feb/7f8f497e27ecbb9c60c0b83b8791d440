A Nigerian sales clerk has been suspended after she told auditors that a snake had eaten 36m naira. That's the equivalent of $100,000 or Â£72,250. The clerk, Philomena Chieshe, was working at an office for the Nigerian examination board which collects exam fees. The exam board, the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board, told the BBC that it dismissed her claim and has started disciplinary proceedings. The incident has been ridiculed by Nigerians on social media. One tweeter suggests it would be an unreasonable amount of bank notes for one snake to handle: JAMB QUESTION- 100MARKS. Calculate how long it will take a snake to swallow 36,000,000 Naira. If the Bank notes are either in 100, 200 or 500 denomination and tabulate the chances of the snakes survival using the APC formula.

Can someone recommend a good spot to chill with babes?
