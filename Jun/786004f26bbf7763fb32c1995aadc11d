Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa says elections will go ahead as planned on 30 July, despite what he said was an attempt on his life on Saturday. Forty-one people were injured in the blast at a rally in the city of Bulawayo, which occurred close to Mr Mnangagwa as he was leaving the stage.

Mr Mnangagwa said Saturday's explosion happened when an object "exploded a few inches away from me - but it is not my time". He said the violence was senseless and appealed for unity. Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa also condemned the attack, saying any political violence was "totally unacceptable". Those hurt included two vice-presidents, the Zanu-PF party chairwoman, members of a state TV crew and security personnel. The president was in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city and an opposition stronghold, to campaign for his Zanu-PF party ahead of the July election. He is favourite to win the poll, but analysts say he also has enemies - both for overthrowing his former mentor, Robert Mugabe, and for being a previous enforcer of the Mugabe regime.
