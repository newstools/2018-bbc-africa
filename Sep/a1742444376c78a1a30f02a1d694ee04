An investigation is under way after a US foreign service officer was found dead in Madagascar, the US state department says. The unnamed officer was found at their residence overnight on Friday, a statement said. A suspect is in custody and both US and Madagascan officials are investigating, it added. A man was caught trying to jump over the fence while fleeing the house, a Malagasy police spokesman told AFP. The island nation, off the south-east coast of Africa, has experienced repeated political instability and is one of the poorest countries in the world. We are deeply saddened to confirm that a U.S. Foreign Service Officer was found dead in their residence in the overnight hours of Friday, September 21. Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and to the @USMadagascar community. pic.twitter.com/ZBLOmk3q3f End of Twitter post  by @statedeptspox Madagascar country profile
