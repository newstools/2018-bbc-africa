A large explosion has struck the centre of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, eyewitnesses say. Local media say the blast, suspected to be from a car bomb, took place in Howlwadag district. A school in the area has collapsed, with children feared to be among the casualties, local journalists say. Somalia is regularly targeted by militants from al-Shabab, which wants to overthrow the country's internationally-backed government. End of Twitter post  by @HarunMaruf Police officer Abdullahi Hussein told Reuters: "A suicide car bomb [rammed] into the district office of Howlwadag in Mogadishu. It is too early to know casualties." Somalia has faced instability and violence since 1991, when the military government was overthrown. The ousting of Mohamed Siad Barre led to a decades-long civil war between rival warlords, and two northern regions - Somaliland and Puntland - effectively broke away from Somalia. Much of the country has effectively been a war zone. A UN-backed unity government was formed in 2012. Al-Shabab has since been driven out of many urban areas but still controls territory in rural regions and carries out gun attacks and bombings on military and civilian targets. The militant group has imposed a strict version of Sharia in areas under its control, including stoning to death women accused of adultery and amputating the hands of thieves.
