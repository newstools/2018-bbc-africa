The US military says it believes some 60 al-Shabab militants were killed by one of its air strikes in central Somalia on Friday. The "precision" strike around Harardere did not injure or kill any civilians, it added in a statement. The US said the attack was carried out as part of a joint effort with Somali forces to hit the al-Shabab group. This was the largest air strike since November 2017 when 100 militants were killed, the statement added.
