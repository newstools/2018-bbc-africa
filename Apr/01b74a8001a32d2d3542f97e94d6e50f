Two dams in Kenya are close to overflowing because of heavy rains, threatening the lives of thousands of people, the Red Cross has told the BBC. Abbas Gullet, the head of the Kenya Red Cross, advised people in east and central regions to move to higher ground because of the flood risk. He said that 200,000 had already been displaced because of flooding, many staying in schools or open areas. Roads have been submerged under water and there have also been landslides. The two dams - Masinga and Kamburu - are fed by water from Mount Kenya. People have been sharing pictures on social media of the aftermath of the flooding, including one of a Red Cross  member of staff helping an elderly man in south-eastern Tana River county, where 50,000 have had to leave their homes. #MondayMotivation One of our staff members going through lengths to rescue those marooned by floodwaters in Tana River County, following heavy rains being  experienced in most parts of the country. pic.twitter.com/TEY0sYl4sR End of Twitter post  by @KenyaRedCross The rains have forced President Uhuru Kenyatta to cancel his travel plans to western Kenya, where marooned houses can be seen below. He was due to attend a high-profile conference and has now decided to read his speech via video link. Reports of families marooned by floodwaters in Ahero, Kisumu, coming in.

My way home every evening. But I have options... 1. Swim across2. Use the overpass to KQ Pride Centre and drive through a KM of black cotton back to my house3. Join Outering Rd and drive to Donholm or Umoja then turn back4. Not go homeViva Nairobi! pic.twitter.com/of1bNr8dCj End of Twitter post  by @mmtairo Another Nairobi tweeter sent out a rallying call for the city's residents to snap similar pictures to show the authorities that there is a drainage problem. Let's document Nairobi's drainage problem using this hashtag ðŸ‘‰ #CityUnderWater. We are tired of Shouting Nairobi Floods, making them think it is an occasional problem.Drainage is a persistent problem so. #CityUnderWater @KenyanTraffic pic.twitter.com/GzSvebEr3e End of Twitter post  by @lagaless And some on social media appreciated that the flood waters had forced motorists to observe traffic rules. The notorious public buses called "matatus" - like the one in the tweet below - are not known for staying in single file. The law against overlapping has been strictly implemented. ðŸ˜Ž #FloodsKe pic.twitter.com/BAZi4ukn7t End of Twitter post  by @MacOtani
